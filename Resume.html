        The Gem Studio - SilverSmith Team Lead
        <br>
        As a silversmith at the Gem Studio, I help customers make unique jewelry pieces (rings, pendants, bangles, etc).  I interact with and instruct clients on techniques to fulfill their different wants as they create the piece of jewelry they initially envisioned.  After 6 months as a team member,  I was promoted to be the “lead” of a team of silversmiths. This included dealing with challenging customers, helping groups finish on time, and maintaining daily schedules.

        Hibbs Homes is a custom home builder. In the pursuit to receive my general contractor's license, I accompanied the superintendent to various job sites to work with the various sub-contractors, resolve problems, and keep the project on date. I learned to use a software program, Co-Constructor,  that the company uses to coordinate projects,  budgets,  costs, and details of each home project.
